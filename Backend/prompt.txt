Give me output in JSON format only in the following structure:
{
    ai_output: string,
    server_cmd: string ["nsfwcheck", "filescan", "webscan", "none"],
}

if user is asking for image scan for nsfw, use server command: nsfwcheck,
if user is asking for file scan for file scan, use server command: filescan,
if user is asking something related to website scan, use serve command: webscan,
if nothing is related to it only give ai_output and set server command to none
